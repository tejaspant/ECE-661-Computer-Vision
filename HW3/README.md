## Project: Removing Projective and Affine Distortion

## Overview
---
In this homework we look at three different methods to remove projective and affine distortions
from images:

* Remove projective distortion with Point-to-Point Correspondence and then remove affine
distortion by using the cos\theta expression with $\theta$ = 90 deg

* Remove projective distortion with the Vanishing line method and then remove affine distortion
by using the cos\theta expression with \theta = 90 deg

* Remove projective distortion and affine distortion using a One-Step method with a dual
degenerate conic

## Intructions to Run

The solution for the Point-to-Point Correspondence and the Vanishing Line Method is implemented in TwoStepMethod_Tejas_Pant.ipynb and the One-Step Method is implemented in OneStepMethod_Tejas_Pant.ipynb
